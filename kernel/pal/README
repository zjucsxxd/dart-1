PAL is short for "Pegasus Application Layer". All kinds of applications, OS level or User
level communicate with PAL in order to receive kernel functionality.

PAL should only be used in User Mode and NOT in Kernel Mode!

Check "subhybrid kernel.png" for more information on Pegasus's architecture

This kernel is brought together thanks to the resources found on the OSDev Wiki
