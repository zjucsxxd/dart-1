## Dart ##
Dart is a model of a [kernel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28computing%29) I worked on back in 2010 and decided I wanted to work on it again. It's architecture resembles the structure of [*UNIX*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) and [*Linux*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux).

## Purpose ##
I love kernel development; I've been involved in the Linux kernel development process, but I still want to go further than that. The purpose of *Dart* isn't to compete against any other kernel, but it's just a way for me to learn more about this subject.
